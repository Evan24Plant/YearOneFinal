This is a function used on our login page. It is setup to take a URL to direct to, a message to print to the screen, and a value of time, in milliseconds, to wait before redirecting. Different conditions are programmed to call this funtion with different values. For instance, if a user just created an account, they already have an automatic confirmation and redirection to the login page, so we don't want them delayed for a second time.
